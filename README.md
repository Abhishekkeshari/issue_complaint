intro: The Customers dealing with problems are not able to approach the organization for the solution. They are also not able to contact the organization. And, finally they are left over with a contact us form or a feedback form, where they are unable to report their problems.

body: Instead of this old school solution, I have come up with an idea of Online Complaint(issue raise) where the Customer can make their account and register their complaints by raising ticket. All the complaints will be stored in a registry and the admin will assign agents to each customer to solve their problems. In this manner, every Customer's problem will be heard and also solved.

conclusion: This Application helps the customer in processing their complaints. The customers can raise the ticket with a detailed description of the issue. An Agent will be assigned to the Customer to solve the problem. Whenever the agent is assigned to the customer they will be notified with an email alert. Customers can view the status of the ticket till the service is provided.
